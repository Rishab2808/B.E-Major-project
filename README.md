# Installation

- Set up a virtual environment: Create a virtual environment to keep your project's dependencies separate from your system's dependencies. You can use tools like virtualenv or conda to create a virtual environment.

```
  pip install virtualenv
  virtualenv <my_env_name>
  source <my_env_name>/bin/activate
```
- Install dependencies: Once you have set up your virtual environment, install the required dependencies for your project using a package manager like pip or conda.

   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
 Run the project using following command
 ```
   streamlit run app.py
```
